# Speech to text

This project leverages the Whisper-large-v3 model, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Users can upload an audio file and receive a highly accurate transcription of the spoken content.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power and importance of AI in automating speech recognition, providing an accessible tool for converting speech to text efficiently. This capability is increasingly valuable across a wide range of industries, including content creation, research, customer service, and accessibility.
